# parallel-codes
that code was first assignment in parallel programming course taught By Dr.Ahmed Shawky

Writing	a	program	that takes	matrix	dimensions	of	2	matrices	from	file	or	console	(based	on	user	
preference).	And	out	there	multiplication	
Note: Must	use	dynamic	allocation

- Example:
Welcome	to	vector	Matrix	multiplication program!!
if	you	want	program	input	matrices	from	file	Enter	1
If	you	want	program	input	2	matrices	from console	Enter	2
2
Please	enter	the	first	matrix	dimensions elements:
3 2
Please	enter	the	first	matrix	elements:
1		2			
5			8			
1			5			
Please	enter	the	second	matrix	dimensions	elements:
2 2
Please	enter	the	first	matrix	elements:
6			8
10			30
Result Matrix	is	(3x2):
26	 68
110	 180
56				158
